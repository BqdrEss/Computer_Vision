Implementations and experiments from computer-vision coursework. The repository currently covers image manipulation, linear algebra, convolution and template matching, edge detection, Canny processing Hough-transform voting, image augmentation, and a CNN classification study.

## Choose what to explore

- **Coursework:** `hw1/`, `hw2/`, `hw3/`, and [image augmentation and CNN classification](coursework/hada/README.md), imported from my `hada` repository.
- **Applied project:** [Surface-inspection baseline](projects/wall-blade-surface-defects/README.md), with its own detector and tests. This follow-up is separate from the historical assignments.

## Structure

- `coursework/hada/`: original augmentation helper and TensorFlow/Keras classification notebook; dataset not included.
- `hw1/`: image loading/manipulation and linear-algebra helpers.
- `hw2/`: convolution, cross-correlation and normalized template matching.
- `hw3/`: Gaussian filtering, image gradients, non-maximum suppression, hysteresis and Hough voting.
- `hw3/references/`: reference arrays used by the edge-detection notebook.
- `projects/wall-blade-surface-defects/`: new surface-anomaly inspection baseline.
- `tests/`: algorithm regression checks.

The `hada` notebook is an unfinished study exercise with separate dependencies and known shape/indexing issues. See its [coursework notes](coursework/hada/README.md) before running it.

## Run

Create an environment with Python 3.10+ and install:

```bash
python -m pip install -r requirements.txt
# Optional notebook dependencies:
python -m pip install pillow scikit-image jupyter
```

The modules are importable directly from their assignment directories. Example:

```bash
python -m unittest discover -s tests -v
python -m unittest discover -s projects/wall-blade-surface-defects -p 'test_*.py' -v
```

The tests cover numerical invariants and small synthetic images. The notebooks contain the original coursework exploration; they are not presented as production computer-vision systems.

## Portfolio status

This is coursework, not a claim of professional deployment. The implementations are documented to make the algorithms reviewable and reproducible. No proprietary data or employer code is included.
